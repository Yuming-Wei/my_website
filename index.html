				<p>I loved playing soccer when I was a kid. Playing soccer with my friend in the neighborhood is one of my best memory in childhood. We had our own soccer team in high school and often competed with other teams in school. I'm now a member of team Dragon in Drexel University for three years since I went to graduate school in Drexel. The Dragon, or we call it "é¾™" in Mandarin, is a sacred symbol in Chinese culture. We called ourself the decedent of Dragon. <br>
				Our team members are all Chinese and mainly consists of current students at Drexel, including graduate and undergraduate. We also have members that is Drexel Alumni like me. We share the same spirit and goal that we always enjoy play soccer together.<br>
				We have two important soccer tournaments each year. One is Chinese Student Soccer Tournament In Philly, another is Northeastern American Chinese Soccer Tournament.<br>
				Below are some pitures of our team and the matches.
